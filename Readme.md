### Overview
We had to develop an application with a Natural User Interface. We had a choice of technologies available to us and an opportunity to combine a lot of technologies that we have worked with over the past four years. We are required to complete a gesture based project. There were many options that we could have used. "The Myo armband measures electrical activity from your muscles to detect five gestures made by your hands. Using a 9-axis IMU, it also senses the motion, orientation and rotation of your forearm. The Myo armband transmits this information over a Bluetooth Smart connection to communicate with compatible devices." The Reason we went with the Myo Armband is because Myo was one of the better devices to control the game space invaders.   

This is a Gesture and Voice Controlled game that is controlled by your hand gestures and voice control. To make the game work with hand gestures we need to use the myo handband. The game is also started by saying "start" and can be paused and reset when defeated. 

### Purpose of the application â€“ design of the application including the screens of the user interface and how it works. 

The purpose of this game is to demonstrate and implement various gesture controls using the Myo Armband. We made a game in java using eclipse and lua script using the myo armband. The game also integrates speech recognition to start the game other features.
